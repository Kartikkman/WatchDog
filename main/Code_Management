/* Techniques Used to Manage the Code * / 

1.Breaking the Large Program into DIfferent Files : 

    i) Creating seperate File for each Module : For Example seperate file for Touch Interface , Bluetooth , Display 
    ii) Creating seperate File for each Layer : Hardware Layer , Application Layer , Constants , Structures 


2. Using Proper Naming Format 

3. Use of Enums , Structure 

4. Creating Document for Each Layer Working 

5. Describing the constants details ( Pin , Clock Config , Baud Rate etc ) 

6. Write the significance of each file at the top 

7. Giving out the examples in each comment descrbing in a proper way 

8. Extern Keyword is very much helpful for declaring the variables , 
    Declare the variables inside the .h file using " extern"  keyword , & define / Initialize  them in the Source File 
    This way the memory allocated to the variables is only once .
